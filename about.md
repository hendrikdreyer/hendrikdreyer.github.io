    <p>Iâ€™m currently a masters student in data science with strengths in software engineering, data engineering, data analysis, statistical analysis, data sets and databases. I have a keen interest in Unified Analytics Platforms and how that can be used to productionise machine learning and artificial intelligence models. As models tend to digress in accuracy over time and therefore need to be retained, validated, tested and released back into production, a Unified Analytics Platform can greatly assist in guiding and supporting the AI/ML development life cycle. As a previous software engineer working on large industrial software projects, I bring a substantial amount of knowledge to the table that can help in realizing a mature AI/ML development life cycle.</p>
