    <h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
    <p class="italic">May 2010 - May 2017</p>
    <p>
	Melbourne Metro Train Control System - 
	I was initially appointed as an integration engineer on the Core TCMS project, 
	which involved the creation of a control system for the Melbourne metropolitan rail system. 
	At that stage Public Transport Victoria (PTV) was having a second go at the system after the initial contractor, 
	Bombardier’s, offering was rejected (four year’s effort and a lot of money down the drain). 
	The integration team had the task of building the system from numerous applications developed in-house. 
	I had the opportunity to work on the early functionality of automating the build and roll-out process. 
	This task involved dev-ops work where you had to get your hands dirty in a lot of Linux bash scripting. 
	After two rounds of re-structuring I was moved onto the Verification and Validation team (V&V), 
	where I had the privilege to write a copious number of test documents (not that much fun). 
	However, it gave me a thorough understanding of the system and it assisted me in executing various systems test, 
	which was required to get the system to higher operational levels. 
	After another couple of re-structuring moves (yes, this project was under pressure from day one and no, 
	it did not turn a profit – at least not at that stage), 
	I took over responsibility for the further development of two major sub systems on the project – 
	Electronic Docking Sheet (EDS) and the Electronic Train Graph (ETG). At that stage both the 
	products were fairly mature and consisted of a code base around 200,000 lines of code. 
	Both the applications were GUI based and was coded in C++. The STL 
	(Standard Template Library), Qt and several inhouse libraries were used to develop these applications. 
	Both applications relied heavily on design patterns architecture (the gang of four). 
	After seven year on the Core TCMS project, I decided to call it quits and pursue my own 
	little start-up company - ADSR Technologies.
