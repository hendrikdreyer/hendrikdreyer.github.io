    <h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
	<h4>Siemens, Australia</h4>
    <p class="italic">May 2010 - May 2017</p>
    <p>
	Melbourne Metro Train Control System - 
	I was initially appointed as an integration engineer on the Core TCMS project, 
	which involved the creation of a control system for the Melbourne metropolitan rail system. 
	At that stage Public Transport Victoria (PTV) was having a second go at the system after the initial contractor, 
	Bombardier’s, offering was rejected (four year’s effort and a lot of money down the drain). 
	The integration team had the task of building the system from numerous applications developed in-house. 
	I had the opportunity to work on the early functionality of automating the build and roll-out process. 
	This task involved dev-ops work where you had to get your hands dirty in a lot of Linux bash scripting. 
	After two rounds of re-structuring I was moved onto the Verification and Validation team (V&V), 
	where I had the privilege to write a copious number of test documents (not that much fun). 
	However, it gave me a thorough understanding of the system and it assisted me in executing various systems tests, 
	which was required to get the system to higher operational levels. 
	After another couple of re-structuring moves (yes, this project was under pressure from day one and no, 
	it did not turn a profit – at least not at that stage), 
	I took over responsibility for the further development of two major sub systems on the project – 
	Electronic Docking Sheet (EDS) and the Electronic Train Graph (ETG). At that stage both the 
	products were fairly mature and consisted of a code base around 200,000 lines of code. 
	Both the applications were GUI based and was coded in C++. The STL 
	(Standard Template Library), Qt and several inhouse libraries were used to develop these applications. 
	Both applications relied heavily on design patterns architecture (the gang of four). 
	After seven year on the Core TCMS project, I decided to call it quits and pursue my own 
	little start-up company - ADSR Technologies.

    <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
    <h4>MoTeC, Australia</h4>	
    <p class="italic">Aug 2008 - May 2010</p>
    <p>
		After arriving in Australia in 2008, I landed my first job with MoTeC as a software engineer. 
		MoTeC is a small boutique engineering firm that develops products for the motor racing industry. 
		MoTeC’s software engineering department was driven by a small number of hard-core software developers, 
		which took exceptional pride in their work and became easily emotional/defensive when you accidentally 
		found a bug in their code. Non the less, their work ethic was second to none. 
		I was given the initial task of developing the software for a small sensor that was fitted on the 
		exhaust of a vehicle where it monitored the air-fuel mixture – it was call the LTC (Lambda-To-CAN). 
		I took up the task with excitement and vigour and as any good software engineer 
		(especially those that worked on military projects and is trained to work according to certain 
		software development guidelines), I started doing requirement gathering and analysis. 
		My first deliverable that I planned was an SRS (Software Requirement Specification). 
		However, after a week, I sensed that my colleagues were showing signs of distress and 
		were asking more and more when they could see some code. I re-assured them that I was on the 
		verge of publishing my newly written SRS and was putting the final touches on it. 
		To say the least, my colleagues were not impressed with the SRS and the reason being 
		is that it was not code. Later, one of the senior engineers told me straight – 
		“the code is the documentation”. It was then that I realised that the practice of 
		Systems Engineering is null and void in MoTeC (today, it might be different, but back in 
		2008, not so much). Fair enough, in an industry where there are no real safety regulations 
		(as compared to the aviation industry), then yes, writing documentation is properly a waist 
		of time and it is rather all about turn around time and pushing as much functionality into 
		your software as humanly possible. I will be forever be thankful for MoTeC giving me my first 
		job in Australia. But, after just under two years, and successfully delivering the LTC and 
		maintaining a few other products, I decided to seek a more structured and regulated environment.
