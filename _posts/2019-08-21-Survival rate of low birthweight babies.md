﻿﻿This paper reports on a statistical investigation that was performed on a given SAS VA dataset, which contains birth data from 671 neonates with birth weight less than 1500g. The investigation seeks to understand if a statistical relevant relationship exists between any of the predictive variables in the dataset and the survival rate of low birth weight babies (null-hypothesis).The analysis of the VLBW data set was done in SAS Visual Analytics.[Link](https://hendrikdreyer.github.io/Survival-Rate-Low-Birth-Weight-Babies)
