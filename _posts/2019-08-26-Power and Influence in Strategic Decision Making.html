and influence</i>, the elixir that society has craved for throughout the ages. Looking
at human history one can draw a straight line through it by following the
people or entities who have wielded power and influence. They were the history makers;
they were the ones that shaped society and defined the underlying narrative on
which modern society is based today. All the way from Zeus, Ra, Moses, <i>Caesar</i>,
Jesus, Napoleon through to Gandhi, Hitler, JFK and Mother Terresa. We stand in awe
of them as they reach into our hearts and minds. Some inspire greatness, others
fear and yet others leave us speechless – especially, every time Donald Trump<a

the world about his “excellent letter” he wrote to Kim Jong-Un (NCAN,
2019). These individuals and entities stand as sentinels in the hallowed halls
of history, reminding us that this secret elixir called <i>power and influence</i>
is the true key to achieving great things. But things are changing at a rapid pace
because, with the advent of big data and <i>Machiavellian</i> amounts of processing
power arose a new <i>fandangle</i> kid - Artificial Intelligence. We are
staring into the very likely possibility that decision making will eventually
be solely done by AI agents (Sincavage,
2017). The burning question that arises is - <i>how will people’s power and influence
and their ability to make strategic decisions</i> <i>be affected by the advent
of AI? </i>  Will we embrace it? Or, will we resist it? (Hughes,
2018)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:200%'>In order to answer those questions, the
author argues, that we only really need to understand <i>homo sapiens</i> and
how <i>power, influence and decision-making</i> presents in this species. We
know by now that <i>machines</i> can, without showing fatigue, make faster and
more accurate decisions than humans. That poses a threat as well as an
opportunity to humanity and if history has taught us anything, then we’ll know
that humans are reactive to both opportunities and threats. But even more, in
our modern day and age, how humans can turn threats into opportunity and vice-a-versa.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:200%'>The following literature review explores the
dynamics between <i>power, influence and the art of strategic decision making</i>
in humans as it takes into consideration various sources of literature, which
range from books, online as well as published articles and blogs that were
written and published during the last decade.  This review will then frame that
understanding in the context of an immediate future in which AI decision making
has already arrived. </p>

is a saying that goes, “<i>Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely</i>”
- what a wonderful thought. How many times have Hollywood explained to us in
excruciating detail how the villain in the story implodes and destroys
him/herself in the final battle with the hero? If we rewind each of those
movies to the beginning, we find that our villain’s journey started the first
time he/she was beaten up on the kindergarten playground, teased about an
incredible acne outbreak or a dog that died. At that point vengeance was sworn.
And we all know that vengeance without power is nothing more than a hissy fit (Seltzer,
2011). And so, the pursuit of power begins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>We’ll never really know if a person with the word “Chief” in
his/her title in the corporate world went through a similar journey in order to
claim a position of power and influence. But, yet, influential, literary entities
such as the Harvard Business Review has printed their presses dry to come to
grips with what real power is in the corporate context. Any search containing
the word “power” on HBR’s website will result in numerous published articles by
renowned industry leaders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>The aptly titled business blog, <a
href="http://www.businessballs.com">www.businessballs.com</a>, lists five types
of leadership powers that were coined by John French and Bertram Raven in 1959.
French and Raven labelled these types of power as <i>Legitimate</i> power, <i>Reward</i>
power, <i>Coercive</i> power, <i>Referent</i> power and <i>Expert</i> power <span
style='line-height:200%'>(“French and Raven’s bases of power,” 2019)</span>. Knowing
the different types of power that are exercised by people in organizations gives
us a better understanding of the power landscape. Power can’t exist in a vacuum;
it needs oxygen from which it can be ignited and launched. Leaders that apply
any number of French and Raven’s five types of power also have specific
leadership styles. Although they exert power in a specific way, they also lead
in a specific way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>The Polish born psychologist, Kurt Lewin, who during his
studies at MIT identified three types of <i>leadership</i> styles named, <i>Authoritarian</i>,
<i>Democratic</i> and <i>Laissez</i>-<i>faire</i> <span
style='line-height:200%'>(“Kurt Lewin,” 2019)</span>. Any combination of the five
types of power and three leadership styles can present itself in a leader. Non
is necessarily better than the other, it all depends on the environment,
circumstances and context. Certain combinations work better for some
environments and then the same combination will underperform in another context
or environment (Harness,
2019).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>But what motivates people to achieve power in an organisation,
besides childhood bullying, <i><span style='color:#222222;background:white'>Acne&nbsp;vulgaris</span></i><span
style='color:#222222;background:white'> or the trauma associated with the loss
of a pet </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>(Gäbler &amp; Maercker, 2011)</span>? David McClelland,
in his 1961 book titled, The Achieving Society, identified three motivators
that he believed we all have: a <i>need</i> for <i>achievement</i>, a <i>need</i>
for <i>affiliation</i>, and a <i>need</i> for <i>power</i> (McClelland,
2010). McClelland built upon the earlier work of our old friend Abraham Maslow,
who created the <i>theory of needs (a.k.a Maslow’s hierarchy of needs – which
forever will make us feel guilty when indulging in too much sleeping, eating
and sex-capades, because we can’t escape the bottom rung of his insidious
pyramid…)</i>, which he so eloquently described in his seminal 1943 paper
titled, “A Theory of Human Motivation” (Maslow,
1943).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>At this point it is necessary to differentiate between
leaders and managers. Managers, in general, are more focused on the tactical
aspects of business (budgeting, reporting, managing projects, etc.) where
leaders are more involved and influential in the overarching vision and mission
of an organisation (Arruda,
2016). Leaders must model the way, challenge the process, enable others and
inspire a shared vision. The underlying mechanisms of power and
leadership/management styles are the same for both these figures. At the end of
the day they adhere to and utilize the same driving forces, which enables them
to lead and manage. </p>

class=Heading2Char><span style='font-weight:normal'> – “</span></span><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>Influence, however, does not stand alone. It has a counterpart
called <i>persuasion</i> and the two work together in mysterious ways (Morgan,
Cialdini, &amp; Hill, 2012). Any leader with any mixture of power and
leadership styles have in some measure the ability to influence and/or persuade
people, events or outcomes. I’ll venture as far as saying that <i>influence</i>
and<i> persuasion</i> are the main instruments that a leader must effectively
wield in his/her daily reign of their domain. For it is through <i>influence</i>
and<i> persuasion</i> that they exert <i>power</i> (Medium,
2019). </p>

and therefore need to be able to discern what information is of value and then
decide which of the available options, as presented by the data, are important
to pursuit. <img width=312 height=238

making is an art, which requires an array of abilities. One can step back and
start off with the highly abstracted question, <i>“How do we decide to decide?”</i>
Understanding the process by which individuals makes decision are as important
as the various factors that influence decision making (Dietrich,
2010). Contemporary decision analysis has identified several abstract dimensions
along which decision processes can be measured and guided (Neal
&amp; Spetzler, 2015). Those same dimensions are now challenged and disrupted
by the way data is starting to drive decisions in organizations (Vermeulen,
2014). As a driving factor, data has become the central point of decision
making (Singh,
2018). Decision making heuristics such as availability, representativeness and
affect, can lead to cognitive biases and render decision making processes less
effective (Cherry,
2019).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>A course of action shapes the strategy wherein an individual
or organization anticipates the opponent’s moves as well as its own, and in
effectively choosing amongst the various options that presents, steers towards
an anticipated outcome (Decker,
2010). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>Strategy, per definition, has everything to do with the long-term
survival idea and in business it is no different. Whether the strategy is to
focus on differentiation  (Kokemuller, 2019), acquisition (Picincu,
2018) or growth, they all have one thing in common – survival. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'><b>Putting it all together</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>Let’s consider a use case. An executive is facing a tough
strategic decision but has to her disposal the input of an AI entity, which has
the capability to process vast quantities of data inside and outside of the
organization and present the most logical and rational decision possible for
the current context and situation. What would the effect of such an aid be on
our executive? Will the executive see the AI’s superior decision making as a
threat? Will our executive feel unwanted, untrusted or even un-appreciated due
to the AI’s perfect input? Or, will our executive “high-jack” the AI’s decisions
and start moulding them towards a specific pre-conceived outcome? Or, will our
executive embrace the AI’s input and together with it drive even further the
envelope of strategic decision analysis?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>It boils down to a one-sided issue to contemplate – how will
the <i>human</i> react to inclusion of AI in the decision space? Again, if
history has taught us anything, then it is that human decision-making
strategies is not one of unalloyed progress toward perfect rationalism. In
fact, over the year’s humans have steadily been coming to terms with
constraints, both contextual and psychological, on our ability to make optimal
choices.&nbsp;Erroneous framing, bounded awareness, excessive optimism - the
debunking of Descartes’s rational man threatens to swamp our confidence in our
choices, with only improved technology acting as a kind of empirical breakwater
<span
style='line-height:200%'>(Buchanan &amp; O’Connell, 2006)</span>. Ouch! That
latter statement strongly suggests that our use case executive will at some
stage face the situation where her decisions are governed, tempered and shaped
by the AI. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:200%'><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>Looking back onto our brief investigation of <i>power, influence</i>,
<i>strategy</i> and <i>decision making, </i>one can only marvel at how
intricate and complex the decision environment can be. We can find an endless number
of permutations amongst individuals based on power drivers and leadership
styles all mixed up into a cauldron of personalities, beliefs, ideas, context
and agendas. Whether that latter concoction of entities produces individuals with
Vulcan-like rationalism or <i>Dopamine</i> crazed decision orgies is and will
be always a bit unclear. Looking at it all from that perspective I feel
inclined to suggest that our use case executive will eventually be pushed into
a dark dusty corner of the decision space. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:200%'>It might sound unfair to pair our use case executive against
AI. Decisions are usually made by group consensus. To be fair, a discussion
regarding <i>power, influence</i> and <i>strategic decision making</i> cannot
be viewed from only the individual’s point of view. Such a study can gleam
insights into the underlying mechanisms of human decision making but, the
narrative must be extended towards the group as well. For this, the author suggests
a further study into the dynamics of group decision making. </p>
