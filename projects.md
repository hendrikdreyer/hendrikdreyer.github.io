    <h3>Survival rate of low birth weight babies</h3>
    <p class="italic">Aug 2018 - Sept 2018</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> 
		According to the World Health Organization (WHO) low birth weight is defined 
		as a weight that is less than 2500g at birth. 
		Throughout the world low birth weight continues to be a considerable health problem . 
		This paper reports on a statistical investigation that was performed on a given SAS VA dataset, 
		which contains birth data from 671 neonates with birth weight less than 1500g. 
		The investigation seeks to understand if a statistical relevant relationship 
		exists between any of the predictive variables in the dataset and the survival 
		rate of low birth weight babies (null-hypothesis). 
		A standard, methodical investigation were performed on all the variables in the 
		dataset and then utilized to build a comprehensive logistic regression model. 
		Several predictive variables were identified as potential influencers in 
		determining/predicting survival rates for neonates and an interesting 
		interaction effect was discovered, which all lend credibility towards 
		supporting the notion of rejecting the null-hypothesis. 
		Additionally, the results from the logistic regression analysis were 
		compared to a decision tree and it was found that the two classification 
		techniques yielded very similar results.

    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> 
		Do black vehicles have a greater mean wheel diameter than white vehicles? 
		The underlying, safe assumption in this regard is that there is no significant 
		difference in mean wheel diameter between black vehicles and white vehicles (null-hypothesis). 
		The R-code can be used as is. Although, 
		the analysis and interpretation of the statistical test is really what this exercise was about.

		This project investigates the relationship between the physical attributes of television appliances

		Utilizing the Caspio cloud based development environment I designed, coded, tested and rolled-out AutoSalesReports (ASR). 
		ASR is a cloud based BI solution for the Australian automotive industry. 
		ASR is a fully integrated CRM and Saleslog system, with advanced BI reporting capabilities. 
		Microsoft SQL Server was used as the cloud database. 
		Extensive Java scripting was used to facilitate a large portion of ASR's functionality in Caspio.

    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span>
		The purpose of this project was to deploy the mechanisms of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset, 
		which contains the categorized death records of the Australian populace since 1907.
		This report presents the interesting idea of visualizing death data in three dimensions. 
		A subtle personification of death is created by visualising death data. 
		In doing so, numerous observations come to light whereby we can gain a better understanding 
		of related entities that are hidden in and between the death numbers, such as correlation between deaths in 
		world war one and two as well as disassociation within deaths in the age groups 85+.

    <p class="italic">Jun 2017 - Dec 2018</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span>
		Let's get a bit philosophical. Concepts of data, information, knowledge and wisdom are the core building blocks of data science. 
		Russell Lincoln Ackoff (1989) was the first to systematically arrange these terms into a hierarchy – 
		referred to variously as the DIKW hierarchy, Knowledge pyramid, Knowledge hierarchy and Information hierarchy – 
		in his article ’From Data to Wisdom’
		This paper lists my thoughts on the DIKW hierarchy against five questions asked.
