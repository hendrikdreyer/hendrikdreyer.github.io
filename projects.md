    <h3>Survival rate of low birth weight babies</h3>
    <p class="italic">Aug 2018 - Sept 2018</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> According to the World Health Organization (WHO) low birth weight is defined as a weight that is less than 2500g at birth. Throughout the world low birth weight continues to be a considerable health problem . This paper reports on a statistical investigation that was performed on a given SAS VA dataset, which contains birth data from 671 neonates with birth weight less than 1500g. The investigation seeks to understand if a statistical relevant relationship exists between any of the predictive variables in the dataset and the survival rate of low birth weight babies (null-hypothesis). A standard, methodical investigation were performed on all the variables in the dataset and then utilized to build a comprehensive logistic regression model. Several predictive variables were identified as potential influencers in determining/predicting survival rates for neonates and an interesting interaction effect was discovered, which all lend credibility towards supporting the notion of rejecting the null-hypothesis. Additionally, the results from the logistic regression analysis were compared to a decision tree and it was found that the two classification techniques yielded very similar results.</p>

    <h3>Black vs. White</h3>
    <p class="italic">Jun 2018 - Jun 2018</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> Do black vehicles have a greater mean wheel diameter than white vehicles? The underlying, safe assumption in this regard is that there is no significant difference in mean wheel diameter between black vehicles and white vehicles (null-hypothesis). The R-code can be used as is. Although, the analysis and interpretation of the statistical test is really what this exercise was about.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of TV Energy Ratings</h3>
    <p class="italic">Jan 2018 - Feb 2018</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> 
	This project investigates the relationship between the physical attributes of television appliances 
	(screen size, power consumption and technology) and their associated energy ratings.The R-code can be 
	executed as is. It will attempt to read the main datafile from the data.gov.au site. If this fails
	(due to the file being removed, changed or renamed, I have added the original data file in the repo) 
	The attached pdf file is a writeup of the analysis.</p>
