    <h3>Survival rate of low birth weight babies</h3>
    <p class="italic">Aug 2018 - Sept 2018</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> According to the World Health Organization (WHO) low birth weight is defined as a weight that is less than 2500g at birth. Throughout the world low birth weight continues to be a considerable health problem . This paper reports on a statistical investigation that was performed on a given SAS VA dataset, which contains birth data from 671 neonates with birth weight less than 1500g. The investigation seeks to understand if a statistical relevant relationship exists between any of the predictive variables in the dataset and the survival rate of low birth weight babies (null-hypothesis). A standard, methodical investigation were performed on all the variables in the dataset and then utilized to build a comprehensive logistic regression model. Several predictive variables were identified as potential influencers in determining/predicting survival rates for neonates and an interesting interaction effect was discovered, which all lend credibility towards supporting the notion of rejecting the null-hypothesis. Additionally, the results from the logistic regression analysis were compared to a decision tree and it was found that the two classification techniques yielded very similar results.</p>

    <h3>Black vs. White</h3>
    <p class="italic">Summer 2012 - Summer 2014</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Abstract:</span> Do black vehicles have a greater mean wheel diameter than white vehicles? The underlying, safe assumption in this regard is that there is no significant difference in mean wheel diameter between black vehicles and white vehicles (null-hypothesis). The R-code can be used as is. Although, the analysis and interpretation of the statistical test is really what this exercise was about.</p>

    <h3>Intuit Software Engineer Intern</h3>
    <p class="italic">June 2015 - August 2015</p>
    <p>As an intern on the Intuit QuickBooks Mobile iOS team, I taught myself Objective-C, Swift 2, and SQL on the job. I helped pioneer my team's transition from Objective-C to Swift and the adoption of Apple's latest guidelines for universal iOS apps to accommodate multitasking in iOS 9. I also added employee time-tracking and time-sheets features to the iOS app. My work involved full stack development from database management and memory-efficiency optimizations to adaptive UI design and animations.</p>

    <h3>Photo Licensing Platform</h3>
    <p class="italic">September 2015 - present</p>
    <p>Currently, there is no centralized platform for media consumers to easily purhcase licenses from photographers and graphic designers. Through Stanford Code the Change, I am leading a team to create a prototype web application that simplifies the process of creating and purchasing licenses for copyrighted photos and images. This proof-of-concept app was built in collaboration with the U.S. Copyright Office and the Stanford Law School. For this project, I used Python, Flask, and SQL, and then deployed the app to Heroku.</p>

    <p>Mood Music is a Firefox add-on that provides users with content-relevant music that reflects the mood of the websites they visit. It uses a combination of text-extraction through Diffbot, natural language processing of mood, and integration with the Rdio API to create this Firefox add-on. The inspiration behind this lies in alleviating the burden of finding good music during a userâ€™s browsing experience.</p>
